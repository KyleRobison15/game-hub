## Project Inspiration
This is an educational project that I created by following the "React 18 for Beginners" course on www.codewithmosh.com.  Before completing this course I had about 1 year of experience with React, but it was a bit outdated as many React development best practices have evolved since the time I first learned React.  The course was an excellent refresher on React fundamentals, but more than anything, it was a great guide for adding several modern React features and best practices to my toolbox as a Full Time Developer.

## Project Overview
GameHub is a simple, yet elegant web application for browsing video games.  It is powered by a third party API from RAWG.io which, per their API docs ([rawg.io/apidocs](https://rawg.io/apidocs)), is the largest video game database and game discovery service available. Since the API is free to use and the backend was already in place, I was able to focus all my energy on honing in my front end development skills with React. 

To build this UI, I utilized React and Typescript along with Chakra UI to create a clean and consistent feel, and to gain practice implementing a third party component library. Enjoy!
